# Examining Stock Pricing Anomalies

![enter image description here][1]

Stock markets are volatile environments in which there is wild fluctuation. This project explores the notion of "anomaly" within the market. Stock returns for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and its components are aggregated as a function of time. This signal is transformed into an anomaly curve by utilizing previous time points to examine the probability that a current time point arose from the distribution of prior time points (estimated by kernel density estimate). Statistical analysis and visualization were performed to assess the relation of volatility and return on anomaly as well as inter-anomaly correlation. The notion of systemic anomaly is also explored.
